# {{ header("Content Digests") }}

In order to ensure that the content transmitted via SWORD is correct when it arrives at its destination, clients MUST provide Digests that 
servers MUST check against incoming content.

## {{ header("Announcing Support For Digests", 2) }}

Servers can announce support for the Digest formats that they support in the Service Document as follows:

```json
{{ json_extract(
    source="content/examples/service-document.json",
    keys="digest")
}}
```

The Server SHOULD list all the digest formats that it supports.  Servers MUST support at least SHA-256 and MAY support any other digest 
formats.

The Digest formats MUST be identified as per the IANA HTTP Digest Algorithm values: {{ ref("IANA Digest") }}


## {{ header("Transmitting Digests", 2) }}

SWORD uses the recommendations of {{ ref("RFC3230") }} for transmitting base64 encoded Digests of request bodies.

For every request where there is a request body, the client MUST attach the `Digest` header with the appropriate content:

````
Digest: SHA-256=MzA1ZmIzMDJiZjA4MzUzYTg5ZGY4NDIxMjcyY2JmZTEwNzM5ODdmMjJhY2Y1ZDc5NzFhOTY3MmM1MGNkN2ZlMA==
````

Note that the client MAY send multiple digests from different algorithms, separated by commas in the header:

````
Digest: SHA-256=MzA1ZmIzMDJiZjA4MzUzYTg5ZGY4NDIxMjcyY2JmZTEwNzM5ODdmMjJhY2Y1ZDc5NzFhOTY3MmM1MGNkN2ZlMA==, MD5=ZjQxNjA3N2M3MDdhODJkZGJlMGE0YTk2NGRjZWEyNWE=
````

The server MUST validate at least one digest, SHOULD validate all digests, though MAY choose its preferred format to validate against.
