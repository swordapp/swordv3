<h2>The Documents</h2>

<h3>SWORD: Facilitating Deposit Scenarios</h3>
<p><a href="http://dlib.org/dlib/january12/lewis/01lewis.html">http://dlib.org/dlib/january12/lewis/01lewis.html</a></p>
<p>A review of deposit use cases found during work around SWORD and SONEX in 2012.  Each use case is supported by a number of real-world 
examples.</p>

<h3>Data Deposit Scenarios</h3>
<p><a href="http://swordapp.org/2012/07/data-deposit-scenarios/">http://swordapp.org/2012/07/data-deposit-scenarios/</a></p>
<p>A review of research data deposit scenarios, documented during work around SWORD and SONEX in 2012.  We identified data types, sources,
and target repositories and documented them.  The document lists some real-world examples of data deposit.  It then goes on to list 
generalised requirements for data deposit and carries out a gap analysis on SWORDv2.</p>

<h3>SWORD Community Development Document</h3>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Rh80CbH3F7P8pqK4CqyEMpi-efDclETRMNqyqPO71Z0/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Rh80CbH3F7P8pqK4CqyEMpi-efDclETRMNqyqPO71Z0/edit</a></p>
<p>A document circulated by Jisc in 2016 to gather input on case studies, implementations, requirements and sustainability options.  This
 document is written piecemeal by a number of contributors working with SWORD, so is direct input from implementer base in some cases. </p>

<h3>SWORD Statement of Requirements</h3>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fajFcmFL4jRw4ym_pQTIyec8tqy8NKeLFhemdfqRRts/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fajFcmFL4jRw4ym_pQTIyec8tqy8NKeLFhemdfqRRts/edit</a></p>
<p>A short document pulled together from various notes gathered by Jisc on SWORD, going into 2017.</p>

<h3>Working Principles</h3>
<p>From those documents we devised a short set of working principles that are not requirements or usage patterns, but which would be worth
keeping in mind as the project progressed.</p>
</section>
<section>
<ul>
<li>The more optional features, the harder true interoperability</li>
<li>Simpler the better - aim to remove any unusued features from SWORDv2</li>
<li>Research data support is key, though not at the expense of existing features</li>
<li>Make it easy for the community to engage and developers to pick up</li>
<li>Make it easy to maintain and extend</li>
<li>Be clear about the distinction between protocol and implementation</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<ul>
<li>One single simple (as possible) document describing the protocol</li>
<li>Pay attention to anti-patterns: only one file, only one metadata schema, etc.</li>
<li>Prioritise current, validated and pressing use cases</li>
<li>Make it easy to relate implementations to the parts of the protocol</li>
<li>Minimise the effort to implement against a repository (as few special features as possible)</li>
</ul>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<section>
<h3>Usage Patterns</h3>
<p>A usage pattern is what we called our single units of functionality that we wanted to support.</p>
<p>Smaller than a use case, larger than a user story.</p>
<p>All usage patterns were derived from analysis of the source documents, and from implementation experience with SWORDv2.</p>
<p>Full set <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14gP6ZjH_QX1VjZrh3CeJdgMsML2w0S95GWdYknV3ziE/edit">here</a> (41 in total)</p>
<p>Some examples below.</p>

<section>
<dl><dt><a name="research_data_deposit"></a>Research data deposit</dt><dd>Researchers should be able to easily deposit data for publication, discovery, safe storage, long-term archiving and preservation</dd><dt><a name="transmission_of_data_meeting_metadata_standards"></a>Transmission of data meeting metadata standards</dt><dd>The protocol should support the transfer of well-understood data formats and profiles such as PCDM, METS, RIOXX, etc.</dd><dt><a name="automated_machine-to-machine_deposit"></a>Automated machine-to-machine deposit</dt><dd>Autonomous systems should be able to communicate with eachother as needed via the protocol</dd><dt><a name="man-in-the-middle_broker"></a>Man-in-the-middle broker</dt><dd>Deposits should be possible via a brokerage service or other itermediate, which stands between the depositor and the target archive(s)</dd></dl>

<section>
<dl><dt><a name="real-time_file-storage"></a>Real-time file-storage</dt><dd>The protocol should offer the facilities to enable the repository to behave like a real-time file store for user-facing systems</dd><dt><a name="monitor_workflow_progress"></a>Monitor workflow progress</dt><dd>Be able to track the state of an item as it is in the repository - whether it is in a workflow, in the archive, or if other actions have happened to it</dd><dt><a name="arbitrarily_large_files"></a>Arbitrarily large files</dt><dd>Deposited files may be very large</dd><dt><a name="send_files_by_reference"></a>Send files by reference</dt><dd>Send one or more links to files to be ingested and attached to an item.  Some links may not need to be ingested, a reference may just need to be created</dd></dl>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>The requirements are clean single statements about the capabilities that the specification must have.</p>
